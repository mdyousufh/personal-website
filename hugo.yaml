      I am a Junior Software Engineer currently working at OROCUBE TECH in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering and gained practical experience in backend development using Java and Spring Boot through academic projects and professional work.

      Alongside my professional experience, I am preparing to pursue a Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science to further develop my understanding of software engineering, data-centric systems, and modern computing technologies. I am particularly interested in building reliable backend systems and continuously improving my technical skills through learning and hands-on practice.
